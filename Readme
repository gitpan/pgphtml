After I had read the nice page of Noel Bell (mailto:EJNBell@pobox.com)
"PGP signed web-pages" at http://www.pobox.com/~ejnbell/pgp-www.html, I thought
"nice method but not very simple to use".
For this reason I write a simple perl tool pgphtml to generate PGP or GPG signed
web-pages

This is the syntax

usage:
        pgphtml [-options ...] files

where options include:
    -help                        print out this message
    -gpg                         use GPG instead of PGP
    -verbose                     verbose
    -backup                      save the original files in .bak
    -passwd  yourpgppasswd

files:
    with files you can use metacharacters and relative and absolute path name
    
example:
    pgphtml *.html
    pgphtml -p "myfrase" *.htm

If you want to know more about this tool, you might want
to read the docs. They came together with pgphtml!
