<H4>version 1.1 1997/09/19</H4>

After I had read the nice page of <A HREF="mailto:EJNBell@pobox.com">Noel Bell</A>
<A HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~ejnbell/pgp-www.html">PGP signed web-pages</A>
I thought <EM>nice method but not very simple to use</EM>.
For this reason I wrote the simple perl tool pgphtml to generate PGP signed
web-pages based on Noel Bell methodology. It should be work with perl 4 and 5.<P>

<A HREF="pgphtml.tar.gz">Source Code</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="new.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=11>You can also find the source code at
<A HREF="http://www.perl.org/CPAN/authors/Fabrizio_Pivari">
CPAN authors/Fabrizio_Pivari/</A><P>


This is the sintax<BR>

<PRE>
usage:
        pgphtml [-options ...] files

where options include:
    -help                        print out this message
    -passwd  yourpgppasswd

files:
    with files you can use metacharacters with relative and absolute path name

example:
    pgphtml *.html
    pgphtml -p "myfrase" *.htm
</PRE>

Problems, at the moment:
<UL>
<LI>the script doesn't control if the files are HTML files
<LI>it presumes that exists and is unique the tag &lt;/HTML&gt or
&lt;/html&gt and &ltBODY&gt or &ltbody&gt
</UL>

<IMG SRC="new.gif" WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=11>What's new with version 1.1:
<UL>
<LI>Check if the files are just PGP signed
<LI>Modifies to make simple unpgphtml
</UL>

<H2>How to check the signature on this page
[From <A HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~ejnbell/pgp-www.html">
PGP signed web-pages</A>]</H2>

This page is digitally signed with <A HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~ejnbell/pgp.html">PGP</A>.
You can check to see if it has been altered, by using
<A HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~ejnbell/pgp.html">PGP</A>.

<P>

To do so, download or save this file to your hard drive.
In Netscape, click on the word &QUOT;File&QUOT; on the menu-bar,
then click on &QUOT;Save as&QUOT;. In the &QUOT;Save File as Type
...&QUOT; box, make sure that &QUOT;Source (*.htm)&QUOT; is selected.
Save the file with a &QUOT;.htm&QUOT; or &QUOT;.html&QUOT; extension,
such as "pgp-www.htm&QUOT;. Similar methods will apply to other
browsers. Just make sure you save the file as html source code.

<P>

If you haven't already got my <A HREF="pivari.txt"> PGP public
key</A>, you will need to <A HREF="pivari.txt"> get it now</A>,
and add it to your public keyring. Now, in the same directory
that you have saved the file to, run &QUOT;PGP pgphtml.html&QUOT;
and PGP should tell you that the signature from me is valid.
This proves that the page has not been tampered with.<P>

Enjoy it!
