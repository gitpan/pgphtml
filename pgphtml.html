<H1>PGPHTML: a perl script to make PGP signed web-pages</H1>
<H2>by <A HREF="mailto:Pivari@geocities.com">Fabrizio Pivari</A></H2>
<H4>version 1.0 1997/07/03</H4>

<IMG SRC="pgp-lock-logo.gif" ALT="PGP logo">
After I had read the nice page
<A HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~ejnbell/pgp-www.html">PGP signed web-pages</A>
of <A HREF="mailto:EJNBell@pobox.com">Noel Bell</A>
I thought <EM>nice method but not very simple to use</EM>.
For this reason I write a simple perl tool pgphtml to generate PGP signed
web-pages based on Noel Bell methodology.<P>

<A HREF="pgphtml.tar.gz">Source Code</A><BR>
You can also find the source code at CPAN authors/Fabrizio_Pivari/<P>

This is the sintax<BR>

<PRE>
usage:
        pgphtml [-options ...] files

where options include:
    -help                        print out this message
    -passwd  yourpgppasswd

files:
    with files you can use metacharacters with relative and absolute path name
    
example:
    pgphtml *.html
    pgphtml -p "myfrase" *.htm
</PRE>

Problems, at the moment:
<UL>
<LI>the script doesn't control if the file are HTML files and if they are just PGP signed
<LI>the script doesn't control if the tags &lt;/HTML&gt or &lt;/html&gt and
&ltBODY&gt or &ltbody&gt exist and are unique
</UL>

<H2>How to check the signature on this page</H2>

This page is digitally signed with <A HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~ejnbell/pgp.html">PGP</A>. 
You can check to see if it has been altered, by using 
<A HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~ejnbell/pgp.html">PGP</A>.

<P>

To do so, download or save this file to your hard drive. 
In Netscape, click on the word &QUOT;File&QUOT; on the menu-bar, 
then click on &QUOT;Save as&QUOT;. In the &QUOT;Save File as Type 
...&QUOT; box, make sure that &QUOT;Source (*.htm)&QUOT; is selected.
Save the file with a &QUOT;.htm&QUOT; or &QUOT;.html&QUOT; extension,
such as "pgp-www.htm&QUOT;. Similar methods will apply to other 
browsers. Just make sure you save the file as html source code.

<P>

If you haven't already got my <A HREF="pivari.txt"> PGP public 
key</A>, you will need to <A HREF="pivari.txt"> get it now</A>, 
and add it to your public keyring. Now, in the same directory 
that you have saved the file to, run &QUOT;PGP pgphtml.html&QUOT; 
and PGP should tell you that the signature from me is valid. 
This proves that the page has not been tampered with.<P>

Enjoy it!
